# scripts
A collection of scripts I've written, typically in Bash, for simple or interesting tasks

## change_volume
This script raises or lowers the volume based on a keypress by one step and sends a notification.

## csvmath
This script adds all numbers together in a CSV file. That's all.

## download / upload
These scripts update my local folder for my Mentally Obscure project based on pulling and pushing to/from SSH. It is now outdated as my current system uses a Github repository to push and pull from the remote server.

## ewwstart
This script is a quick start script for my eww commands set up on my local system. It clears the previous eww script running, starts eww again, and runs the eww bar in question.

## hours
This script was a quick script written to calculate time differences for a scripting competition. It has a bug where in certain circumstances : ex [1:28 PM 4:30 PM] gives 4 hours instead of 3 because of not fully considering the circumstances. The competition was to do it in as few lines as possible.
